# Logitech G HUB Supported Games/Applications

## Description
This repository is a resource for finding which games and applications are supported by Logitech G HUB, the software application for Logitech gaming devices.



## Supported games lists
People are usually looking for one of two lists of supported games for G HUB:

* **[(Profile) supported games list](g-hub-games-list.md)**: These are games that support profiles in G HUB, i.e. custom key assignments, non-game-driven Lightsync effects, and sensitivity (for mice), etc.

* **[Lightsync game-driven games list](https://github.com/xyj-3/lightsync-games)**: This list is specifically for games that automatically synchronize device lighting to in-game events, also known as Lightsync game-driven lighting.




## Old version of the supported games list

The supported games list was previously hosted on Gist and was moved here as the new source. The old list is no longer being updated, but can still be found [here](https://gist.github.com/xyj-3/9bd31cbe62f5a791483c40d798bad869).
