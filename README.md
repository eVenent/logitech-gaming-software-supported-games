# Logitech G HUB Supported Games and Applications

## Description
This repository is a resource for finding which games and applications are supported by Logitech G HUB, the software application for Logitech gaming devices.


## Supported games lists
People are usually looking for one of two lists of supported games for G HUB:

* **[(Profile) supported games list](g-hub-games-list.md)**: List of games that can be automatically detected and support profiles in G HUB, i.e. key assignments, non-game-driven Lightsync effects, sensitivity, etc.

* **[Lightsync game-driven games list](https://github.com/xyj-3/lightsync-games)**: Games that automatically synchronize device lighting to in-game events, also known as Lightsync game-driven lighting.


## Fixing Game Detection Issues
G HUB is known to often not detect application installations, even if the game is installed and is supported by the software according to the games list.
If you have encountered this problem, the file [`fixing-detection-issues.md`](fixing-detection-issues.md) in this repo outlines some steps you can try to fix it.


## Old version of the supported games list
The supported games list was previously hosted on Gist and was moved here as the new source. The old list is no longer being updated, but can still be found [here](https://gist.github.com/xyj-3/9bd31cbe62f5a791483c40d798bad869).
